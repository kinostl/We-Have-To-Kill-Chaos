## Werewolf

Can Poison. Basic Instict + Poison Effect?

- No BLU action in XIV that does this. "Apply Poison on Hit Connect" is easy enough to understand. Bad Breath is a 3 so this is probably a 2.

# Ghoul

Can Paralyze

- No BLU action in XIV that does this. "Apply Paralyze on Hit Connect" is easy enough to understand. Bad Breath is a 3 so this is probably a 2.

# Bone

Above average Damage

Sharpened Knife + Paralysis sounds super mean
